# The Tinshed Players crew roster

A small web application for a fictional community theatre. It keeps productions, performances, volunteers, and crew assignments in one place. This is an individual ISYS3001 teaching project based on the supplied *The Tinshed Players* case study; names in the demo seed are fictional.

## Capabilities

- Create and edit volunteers, productions, and performances.
- Assign, change, and remove a volunteer's role on a performance roster.
- Prevent the same role or volunteer being assigned twice to one performance.
- View a volunteer's personal roster, including an empty state.
- Persist records in SQLite and check application health at `/health`.

The prototype has no user accounts or role permissions. Use fictional data only. It is not suitable for managing real volunteer contact details on a public deployment.

## Local setup

Requires Python 3.12 or newer. On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
py -3.12 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
$env:APP_ENV = 'development'
$env:SECRET_KEY = 'a-local-only-random-value'
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m flask --app app run --port 8000
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. On macOS or Linux, use `python3 -m venv .venv`, `.venv/bin/python`, and `export` for environment variables. The SQLite file is created on first start under `instance/` by default. Set `APP_DATABASE` to use another path. A fictional sample can be added to an empty database with:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m flask --app app seed-demo
```

Run focused automated checks with `.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest -q`.

## Configuration and deployment

| Variable | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `APP_ENV` | `development` or `production` | `development` |
| `APP_DATABASE` | SQLite file path | `instance/tinshed.sqlite3` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Signs form sessions | Local-only fallback; required in production |
| `PORT` | Local direct-run port | `8000` |

Do not commit `.env`, SQLite databases, or secrets. Copy `.env.example` only as a starting checklist and set real values in the environment. For a production-style local WSGI run, set `APP_ENV=production` and a strong `SECRET_KEY`, then use:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\waitress-serve.exe --listen=127.0.0.1:8000 app:app
```

`Dockerfile` and `.github/workflows/ci.yml` provide repeatable build and test configuration. The database needs a persistent writable volume outside the container; the sample image uses `/data/tinshed.sqlite3`. HTTPS, authentication, backups, and access control are not implemented, so any public hosting must remain a demonstration with fictional data.

## Project layout

- `app.py`: Flask routes, SQLite schema, validation, and app factory.
- `templates/`: web pages for each workflow.
- `static/`: responsive styles.
- `tests/`: focused workflow and data integrity tests.
- `Dockerfile`: deployment packaging.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: automated test gate.
- `A2_HD_Execution_Plan.md`: scope and assessment evidence plan.

## Known limitations and next steps

The starter case also mentions ticketing, memberships, SMS, equipment inventory, reports, and volunteer availability. These are outside this roster prototype. The next release should add authentication, granular permissions, availability checks, confirmation workflow, and a database backup/restore process before real use.
